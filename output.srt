00:00:00,256 --> 00:00:04,096
The Cavaliers in the 17-18 season are really internal and external.

2
00:00:04,608 --> 00:00:06,912
Even Lebron James was extremely tired.

3
00:00:07,168 --> 00:00:08,704
The record was once struggling.

00:00:09,216 --> 00:00:12,544
Seeing the emperor's twilight, the pack of wolves stared at his throne.

00:00:12,544 --> 00:00:15,616
Both sides bite to the last second of overtime.

7
00:00:16,128 --> 00:00:19,712
The knight's life is hanging by a thread, and Lebron personally holds the knife.

8
00:00:20,736 --> 00:00:21,504
This is my time

9
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:23,296
Itâ€™s too early to replace me.

00:00:23,808 --> 00:00:28,928
In 2018, compared to the immediate playoffs, the free market that summer was already undercurrent.

00:00:29,696 --> 00:00:36,096
The 17-year war of riding and bravery, with the joining of Durant, broke the evenly matched situation between the two sides.


15
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:38,656
LeBron Was Defeated again

16
00:00:38,912 --> 00:00:44,288
The Cavaliers management not only lost in the arms race, but even their second-in-chief Irvin could not be retained.

00:00:45,312 --> 00:00:50,432
The Cavaliers eventually only traded for Thomas from Boston. This made Lebron very dissatisfied.
